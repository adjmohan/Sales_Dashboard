## üìä Excel Sales Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive sales analysis project using Microsoft Excel to derive insights from sales data and present them in an interactive dashboard.

## üìú Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze the provided sales dataset to identify key trends, top-performing categories, and profitability metrics. The final output is an interactive dashboard in Excel that allows users to dynamically filter and explore the data to gain actionable insights.

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is data.xlsx. It contains transactional data for a retail company.

# Key columns in the dataset include:

 ->Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.

 ->Order Date: Date the order was placed.

 ->Customer Name: Name of the customer.

 ->Region: The geographical region of the sale.

 ->Category: The main product category.

 ->Sub-Category: The specific product sub-category.

 ->Product Name: The name of the product.

 ->Sales: The total sale amount for the transaction.

 ->Quantity: The number of units sold.

 ->Profit: The profit generated from the transaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
* Microsoft Excel: The primary tool for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

* PivotTables: Used to summarize and aggregate the data.

* PivotCharts: For creating dynamic charts based on PivotTable data.

* Slicers: To provide interactive filtering capabilities on the dashboard.

* Formulas: For creating calculated fields and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## üìà Analysis and Visualization
The project culminates in an interactive dashboard (Sales Dashboard.png) which includes the following components:

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Total Orders: Total number of orders placed.

* Total Quantity: Total quantity of products sold.

* Total Sales: Total revenue generated.

* Total Profit: Total profit earned.

# Visualizations

* Sales Trend Year Wise: An area chart showing the trend of sales over different quarters and years.

* Sales vs Profit Year Wise: A column chart comparing total sales against total profit for each year.

* Average Sales by Year: A bar chart displaying the average sale amount per order for each year.

* Detailed Breakdown Table: A PivotTable showing Quantity, Sales, and Profit for each Sub-Category.

## üí° Key Insights

 ->Sales Growth:The "Sales Trend Year Wise" chart indicates a significant and consistent upward trend in sales, with Q4 being the strongest quarter.

 ->Profitability Analysis: The "Sales vs Profit Year Wise" chart helps in understanding the profitability over the years. For instance, while 2016 had high sales, its corresponding profit was relatively low, suggesting potential issues with margins or high-cost products during that period.

 ->Product Performance: The detailed table allows for quick identification of the most and least profitable sub-categories. For example, Copiers and Phones appear to be highly profitable, whereas Tables and Bookcases have incurred losses.

## üöÄ How to Use the Dashboard

1.Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.

2.Use the Slicers on the left-hand side to filter the data:

  * Region: Click on a region (e.g., Central, East) to see data specific to that region.

  * Sub-Category: Select one or more sub-categories to analyze their performance.

3.Interact with Charts: Hover over the charts to see detailed data points. The charts and KPIs will update automatically based on your
  filter selections.
